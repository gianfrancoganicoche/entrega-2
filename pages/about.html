            <p class="about-text">The first coffee shops opened in Istanbul in the year 1550, with great success and quickly grew. These establishments were meeting points for the Turks who met to discuss men's issues and thus escape from everyday life. Although the sultans tried, on many occasions, to ban coffee shops, they failed to obtain positive results, since that would have harmed the high tax they obtained from the coffee trade in Europe and the territories of the Ottoman Empire. 
            <p class="about-text">Soon the custom of coffee shops exclusively for Turks spread throughout the Balkan territories occupied by them, and it is presumed that the concept entered Christian Europe through the Kingdom of Hungary, since it constantly acted as a mediator between the Holy Empire Roman Germanic and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
            <p class="about-text">One of the first European coffee shops established based on the Turkish ones was in 1624, in Venice, known as "Noba". Subsequently, the concept spread widely throughout Europe and in 1652 the first of the later famous Parisian cafeterias with the name of Caf√© Procope was installed in Paris, frequented by illustrious men such as Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau and Benjamin Franklin among others. In 1692 the first coffee shop was opened in the city of London. Then the same thing would happen in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest.</p>
